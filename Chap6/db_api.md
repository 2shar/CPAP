Python DB-API is a standard to which different Python database adapters ought
to conform. It is a specification that states a set of required objects and
database access processes to provide uniform behaviour across different
database adapters.

It is a good thing as it allows for the database adapters to be similar enough
to be learned fast and switched to and from swiftly. This enables rapid
prototyping and testing and allows the developer to choose the best database
adapter and the underlying database system quickly.
