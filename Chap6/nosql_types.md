There are 4 different types of NoSQL databases:

1. Key-Value Store - Has a big hash table of keys and values (examples include Riak, Amazon S3)
2. Document-based Store - Stores documents made up of tagged elements (CouchDB, MongoDB)
3. Column-based Store - Each storage block contains data from only one column (HBase, Cassandra)
4. Graph-based - A network database that uses edges and nodes to represent and store data (Neo4J)

Following have atleast one Python adapter:
Amazon S3, MongoDB, Cassandra, Neo4J

P.S: There are high chances that the databases I didn't mention in the above list also have Python
adapters.
