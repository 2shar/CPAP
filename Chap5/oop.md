# Relationship between Child and Parent Widgets

Widgets can be stand-alone or be containers. A widget containing other widgets
is called the _parent_ of the contained widgets. By the same logic, if a widget
is contained in another widget, it is considered a _child_ widget of the _parent_
widget, where the _parent_ widget is the next immediately enclosing container
widget.
