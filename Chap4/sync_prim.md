# Synchronization Primitives
## My answer to Exercise 4-11

### Locks
`Lock`s are perhaps the simplest synchronization primitives in Python. A `Lock` has
only two states - locked and unlocked (surprise). It is created in the unlocked
state and has two principal methods - `acquire()` and `release()`. The `acquire()`
method locks the `Lock` and blocks execution until the `require()` method in some
other coroutine sets it to unlocked. Then it locks the `Lock` again
and returns `True`. The `release()` method should only be called in the locked
state, it sets the state to unlocked and returns immediately. If `release()` is
called in the unlocked state, a `RunTimeError` is raised.

Snippet:
```
lock = Lock()
g = 0

def add_one():
    lock.acquire()
    g += 1
    lock.release()

def add_two():
    lock.acquire()
    g += 2
    lock.release()

threads = []
for func in [add_one, add_two]:
    threads.append(Thread(target=func))
    threads[-1].start()

print(g)
```

### RLocks
The standard `Lock` doesnâ€™t know which thread is currently holding the
lock. If the lock is held, any thread that attempts to acquire it will
block, even if the same thread itself is already holding the lock.
In such cases, `RLock` (re-entrant lock) is used.

Snippet:
```
import threading

num = 0

lock = Threading.Lock()
lock.acquire()
num += 1
lock.acquire()  # This will block.
num += 2
lock.release()

# With RLock, that problem doesn't happen.
lock = Threading.RLock()
lock.acquire()
num += 3
lock.acquire()  # This won't block.
num += 4
lock.release()
lock.release() # You need to call release once for each call to acquire.
```

One good use case for `RLock`s is recursion, when a parent call  of a function would otherwise
block its nested call. Thus, the main use for `RLock`s is nested access to shared
resources.

###Events
The `Event` synchronization primitive acts as a simple communicator between
threads. They are based on an internal flag which threads can `set()` or `clear()`.
Other threads can `wait()` for the internal flag to be `set()`. The `wait()`
method blocks until the flag becomes true. Following snippet demonstrates how
`Event`s can be used to trigger actions.

Snippet:
```
import random, time
from threading import Event, Thread

event = Event()

def waiter(event, nloops):
    for i in range(nloops):
        print("%s. Waiting for the flag to be set." % (i+1))
        event.wait()  # Blocks until the flag becomes true.
        print("Wait complete at:", time.ctime(), "\n")
        event.clear()  # Resets the flag.

def setter(event, nloops):
    for i in range(nloops):
        time.sleep(random.randrange(2, 5))  # Sleeps for some time.
        event.set()

threads = []
nloops = random.randrange(3, 6)
threads.append(Thread(target=waiter, args=(event, nloops)))
threads[-1].start()
threads.append(Thread(target=setter, args=(event, nloops)))
threads[-1].start()

for thread in threads:
    thread.join()
print("All done.")
```

### Conditions
A `Condition` object is simply a more advanced version of the `Event` object. It
too acts as a communicator between threads and can be used to `notify()` other
threads about a change in the state of the program. For example, it can be used
to signal the availability of a resource for consumption. Other threads must
also `acquire()` the condition (and thus its related lock) before `wait()`ing for the condition
to be satisfied. Also, a thread should `release()` a `Condition` once it's done
with working with the related actions, so that other threads can acquire it for
their purposes.Following snippet demonstrates the implementation of a simple
producer-consumer problem with the help of the `Condition` object.

Snippet:
```
import random, time
from threading import Condition, Thread

# This will be used to represent the availability of a produced item.
condition = Condition()

box = []

def producer(box, nitems):
    for i in range(nitems):
        time.sleep(random.randrange(2, 5))  # Sleeps for some time.
        condition.acquire()
        num = random.randint(1, 10)
        box.append(num)  # Puts an item into box for consumption.
        condition.notify()  # Notifies the consumer about the availability.
        print("Produced:", num)
        condition.release()

def consumer(box, nitems):
    for i in range(nitems):
        condition.acquire()
        condition.wait()  # Blocks until an item is available for consumption.
        print("%s: Acquired: %s" % (time.ctime(), box.pop()))
        condition.release()

threads = []
nloops = random.randrange(3, 6)  # Number of times an item will be produced and consumed.
for func in [producer, consumer]:
    threads.append(Thread(target=func, args=(box, nloops)))
    threads[-1].start()  # Starts the thread.

for thread in threads:
    '''Waits for the threads to complete before moving on
       with the main script.
    '''
    thread.join()
print("All done.")
```

There can be other uses of `Conditions`. I think they will be useful when you're
developing a streaming API which notifies a waiting client once a piece of data
is available.
